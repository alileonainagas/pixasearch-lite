**Hey there, folks!** In the current SPA I implemented Vite 2.0 Front-End tool with some new stuff I've been learning lately... _PostCSS_ amazed me since the first time so I kept an eye on it and use it along with Tailwind CSS as well. All the image data came from the _Pixabay_ API so it's surely safe to fetch that data tho. _Ã€ la prochaine!_
